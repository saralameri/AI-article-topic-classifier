Dubai-based Chiara Noja who represents Jumeirah Golf Estates, shot a brilliant final round of seven under par 65 to tie England’s Charley Hull and then beat her in the play-off in the 54-hole $1 million Ladies European Tour’s ARAMCO Team Series at Royal Greens Golf & Country Club, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

16 year-old Chiara started her final round: birdie – birdie – par - eagle to move into contention, having been tied seventh three back of second round leader Hull.

A front nine of four birdies and the eagle plus a bogey on hole 8, saw Chiara in the mix to be out in 31.

Further birdies on 11, 12 and a brilliant birdie two on the signature 16th hole saw Chiara with a two shot advantage.

A bogey – par, 5 – 5 finish by Chiara saw her finish on a 13 under par score of 203. That left Chiara needing to wait on the practice putting green adjacent to the 18th green after marking her card, to watch the fast finishing Hull, who birdied holes 13, 14, 15 and 17 and standing on the 18th tee needing a birdie to win on the 54th hole.

In the end Hull settled for a par on the home hole to tie with Chiara at 13 under par.

In the play-off Chiara birdied on the second extra hole (18th hole) to take home the trophy and first prize of $74,438.25.

'Stress and happiness'
On completing her round Chiara said, ‘I don’t think it’s sunk in quite yet! I think the stress and happiness will come later this evening,’ said the teenager, who finished second on the LET Access Series Order of Merit in 2022.

‘It is hard work over a lot of years, and a lot of commitment and just trying not to back out of shots and commit to everything that I do and not be afraid to fail.’

‘I can’t even like begin to fathom what I’ve just done. I’m just going to try and relax tonight. Maybe have a burger, I don’t know, treat myself! Sleep. I think it’ll be the best night of sleep I’m probably ever going to get, and see how I feel tomorrow.’

It is just her 9th Ladies European Tour event of her career and was in the field courtesy of a sponsor’s invite.
