There was an opportunity to get pampered and get into the spirit of the event with a free glitter face paint station in the Championship Village.

And there was even a chance to come in their ‘Saturday Best’ and take part in the Best Dressed Competition, for the chance to win a wide variety of gifts and prizes. Two categories were possible to enter, either ‘Best Activewear or Golf wear’ or ‘Best Lifestyle’ lady!
