Stock - Twitter
Following Elon Musk's dramatic Twitter takeover, nearly 50 per cent of their 7,500-strong staff were fired on Friday. A report followed that Meta, Facebook's parent firm, would begin begin large-scale layoffs this week. Tech firms have seen major stock slumps and layoffs have been announced at almost all of the major technology firms. Now, the tech companies face a different economic reality. More than 104,000 startup workers have lost their jobs so far this year, surpassing the roughly 81,000 posts shed in 2020.

While layoffs bring economic pain to households, investors tend to look favorably on them because they mean lower costs and higher profits. Meta rose 3.7% after the report and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.6% on Monday.
